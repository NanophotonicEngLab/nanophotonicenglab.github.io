<!-- **Hydrogen fuel cells** -->
The areal energy density of fuel cells and batteries is proportional to the mass loading of the electrochemically active materials. Therefore, an effective approach to increase the areal energy density is to load more electrochemically active materials within the implementation of carbon and footprint-constrained energy planning. 

As can be expected, the development of 3D architecture electrodes hold promise for the implementation of highly efficient energy and power capabilities of fuel cells and batteries. But, despite the development of some proof-of-concept examples, no current 3D electrodes simultaneously possess all these key features. This problem is hindering successful implementation of energy applications. Hence, successful development of 3D architecture electrodes with dimensional compatibility, high mass activity, and high electrochemical performance is essential for further advancement of energy applications.

This project involves 3D phoamtonics (derived from the terms ‘foam’ and ‘photonics’)-based templating, optical characterization using Fourier Image Spectroscopy (FIS) setup, electrodeposition, and a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process to fabricate 3D architecture electrodes with a high active volume fraction. Also, to develop platinum group metal-free catalysts, we propose a 3D nitrogen–carbon–Ni foam heterostructures, which enable a large specific surface area to realize high mass loading of the electrochemically active materials and to reduce the cost by using Pt-free materials for hydrogen fuel cells. These 3D architecture electrodes will significantly advance the research towards industrial-scale water electrolysis.
